# 1. Overview:
This is a personal page website covering my basic portfolio such as CV , my interests and a professional introduction. The website was created using HTML ,CSS , Vanilla JS and JQuery. The first three of these are the foundational technologies in today's web upon which all other front-end technologies are built. The fourth, jQuery, is an very useful JavaScript library that helps to smooth the seams between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br />
All the javascript and JQuery code is placed inside a folder name 'javascripts'.<br />
All the CSS styling code is placed inside the 'css' folder.<br />
