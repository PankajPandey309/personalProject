      Sports
      </h2>
     <p>
        I have always been interested in sports. I have played basketball, volleyball, and cricket. 
        I also have a passion for playing soccer. I am also a use of indoor sports such as carrom and particularly chess.
        I developed an interest in chess during my 5th standard. I was very new to chess and somehow found myself competing for my house in the junior chess championship. 
        I finished the championship in the second place and have been playing it ever since. I have also represented my house in various inter and intra school sport competitions during middle school 
        and high school.

      <h2>
        Music
        </h2>
      <p>
        I have been playing music since I was a child. I have been playing guitar since I was a child. 
        More than anything, I love listening to music. Some would say that I am a music buff. My ears are surgically attached to my headphones :). 
        My taste in music ranges from classical to rock be in Indian or western music. Some of my favourites artists/bands are Twenty-one pilots , Adele , Linkin Park. 
      </p>

      <h2>Reading</h2>
      <p>
        I also enjoy reading novels in my leisure time. I have read a lot of novels from all genres. I have a 
        proclovity to reading fiction novels especially those set in pre-modern eras. My favourite novel would be 
        The Fall of Giants by Ken Folett.
